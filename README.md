# algo
Go Lang Playground for writing test programmes and implementing algorighms

Please be kind as this code is produced while I am learning go and is an experiment and is not meant for full solutions to the problems;

So far available:

## MergeSort

Use:

    import "github.com/BobbyKostadinov/algo/mergesort"

Then there is only one exported method and can be envoced like this passing it a slice of int

    mergesort.Sort(A)
